# webtown
A simple offline webtoon reader that is specific for my use case.

### a little background
I was looking for an app for macOS to read my offline collection of webtoons (which are basically just folders that contain images of each chapter) but I had a hard time finding one that supports vertical scrolling just like how you would scroll a webtoon. So I figured I should just make my own and have fun in the process!
